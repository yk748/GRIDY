# GRIDY

GRoup Integrative DYnamic factor models (GRIDY) is a dynamic factor model-based group-level analysis of multiple subjects' time series data. A fully functioning package is under development and is expected to be released soon. The corresponding manuscript is [Kim et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15330). The version that contains processed files including simulation and data application results from these R codes can be found at https://zenodo.org/records/13711280.
